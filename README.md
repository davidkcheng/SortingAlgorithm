# SortingAlgorithm
I use C++ to implement Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, Quicksort, and Bubble Sort (see page 40 of the textbook) to develop five word processors
#Input
The input consists of a sequence of words, numbers, and symbols, separated by blanks, punctuation marks, and/or line breakers (end of line).
#Output
The first line of output contains a number indicating the total number of words, followed by a list of words.
In addition, behind each word I output its occurrences and a list of the positions (row order) they appear in the article as shown in the following table. For example, the occurrence of IC is 1 and it is the 3rd word of the line 2.
